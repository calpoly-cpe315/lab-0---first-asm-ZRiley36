# CPE 315 Lab 1 -- Eggnog Haiku

## Things to include in your README

* Zachary Riley. I normally go by Zach, but either is fine.
* Status of lab:
  * Complete
* Compilation and execution instructions
  * `gcc -o eggnog eggnog.s`
  * `./eggnog`

These README files have a fairly rich _Markdown_ environment. You should use
markdown syntax to format your README files in such a way that they look
professional, and are easy to read. Use the 
[Markdown Guide](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/), and
have fun! :octocat:
